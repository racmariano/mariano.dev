                  Integrations split in January 2019, and I joined the data
                  augmentation team. We are responsible for higher level
                  functions of integration data, such as serving dynamic coupon
                  codes and location-based product recommendations.

                  We have been building a Python3 microservice deployed via
                  Kubernetes for storing and manipulating catalog data. It uses
                  gRPC to talk to our monolith and handles over 1 billion
                  requests each week. We built it to create an intuitive API for
                  downstream teams and to leverage location-based
                  functionalities using Postgres and PostGIS.

                  are salamanders that have the amazing ability to fully
                  regenerate their limbs upon injury. With recent technological
