                  Integrations split in January 2019, and I joined the data

                  functions of integration data, such as serving dynamic coupon

                  We have been building a Python3 microservice deployed via
                  Kubernetes for storing and manipulating catalog data. It uses
                  gRPC to talk to our monolith and handles over 1 billion
                  requests each week. We built it to create an intuitive API for
                  downstream teams and to leverage the geographic capabilities
                  of PostGIS.

                  are salamanders that have the amazing ability to fully
                  regenerate their limbs upon injury. With recent technological
