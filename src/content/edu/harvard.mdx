are salamanders that have the amazing ability to fully
regenerate their limbs upon injury. With recent technological
advances, we can now research how individual cells contribute
to regeneration.

In [Dr. Jessica Whited's lab](https://www.whitedlab.com/), we used 
[single cell RNA sequencing](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.cell.2015.04.044)
to profile cells from regenerating and intact limbs. I did
preliminary analysis of the data from our first two
experiments, including transforming the raw gene sequence data
into a high-dimensional gene x cell matrix and identifying
populations of different cell types using linear algebra
techniques.

I also participated in [Harvard Medical School Kindling Interest in Doing Science](https://bsp.hms.harvard.edu/scholastic-partnerships/hms-kids)
summer program and [Health Professions Recruitment & Exposure Program](https://hprep.wordpress.com/)
to teach middle and high school students about science and to prepare them for pursuing STEM tracks in college.
