I completed my Biochemistry-Computer Science dual undergraduate degree at the University of Miami. I also
minored in chemistry, French, and mathematics.

At UM, I served on the executive board of the Anime Club. Each fall we raised money for Miami Children's Hospital by hosting
[ExtraLife](https://www.extra-life.org/), a 24 hour video game marathon.
Each spring we hosted [Miami Hurricon](https://www.themiamihurricane.com/2013/04/14/hurricons-anime-celebration-transforms-campus/), a free anime convention that drew thousands of attendees.

I also played on the women's ultimate frisbee team in my senior year.
