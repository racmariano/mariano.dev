### Software Engineer, Data Augmentation:

In October 2018, I chose to join a small team in charge of developing Klaviyo's first microservice cut from our monolith.
We built a Python3 microservice deployed via Kubernetes for storing and manipulating all customer catalog data, such as
products, their categories, and product-related subscriptions. We have ported our infrastructure into a boilerplate repo that
several teams are now using to build their own microservices.

Our service communicated with our monolith via gRPC and handled over 1 billion requests each week. We built it to
create an intuitive interface for downstream teams and to leverage the geographic capabilities of PostGIS for product
locations. In addition, we were responsible for serving single-use coupon codes and location-based product recommendations to downstream
email-sending teams, thereby allowing our customers to send more personalized emails.
