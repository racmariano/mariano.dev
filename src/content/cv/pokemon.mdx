I currently work at [The Pokémon Company International](https://www.pokemon.com/us/about-pokemon/) on the Organized Play team.
I'm helping build a Python3/Django service to replace the monolith that supports [Play! Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/).
This service currently supplies data to the [Event Locator](https://events.pokemon.com/en-us/) and [Retail Locator](https://events.pokemon.com/en-us/locations).
It also ingests tournament data from the [Pokémon Event Manager](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/the-new-pokemon-event-manager-has-arrived/).

My current projects involve back-end support for [2022 Championships](https://pokemongolive.com/post/pgo-championship-announce-details/?hl=en), including performance improvements and integration with GO/Niantic data.

When I'm not writing [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) APIs, designing data flows, or integrating with internal clients,
I periodically assist my front-end teammates with the Pokémon Event Manager, an [Electron app](https://www.electronjs.org/) that runs tournaments.

From 2020 through early 2022, I was a Women in Tech lead and coordinated internal events such as tea-times and Certified Scrum Master training.
