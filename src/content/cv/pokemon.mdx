I currently work at [The Pokémon Company International](https://www.pokemon.com/us/about-pokemon/) on the Organized Play team.
I'm building a Python3/Django service to replace the monolith that supports [Play! Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/).
This service currently supports the [Retail Locator](https://events.pokemon.com/en-us/locations). When I'm not writing [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) APIs, designing data flows, or integrating with internal clients,
I assist my front-end teammates with the [Pokémon Event Manager](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/the-new-pokemon-event-manager-has-arrived/), which is an
[Electron app](https://www.electronjs.org/) for running tournaments.

I'm also on the Womxn in Tech planning committee, where I help coordinate internal events and promote conference attendance.
