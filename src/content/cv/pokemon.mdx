I currently work at [The Pokémon Company International](https://www.pokemon.com/us/about-pokemon/) on the Organized Play team.
I'm building a Django service to replace the monolith that supports [Play! Pokémon](https://www.electronjs.org/). When I'm not writing DRF APIs, designing data
flows, or integrating with internal clients, I assist my front-end teammates with the [Electron app](https://www.electronjs.org/) we're developing.

What I'm working on is pretty secret, but hopefully I'll be able to share more once it's released.
