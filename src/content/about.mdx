I'm a software engineer who lives and works in Seattle.
Growing up, I wanted to be a scientist like my Dad. In college, I pursued
a dual major in Biochemistry and Computer Science so that I could work
with data over their entire lifecycle.

When I graduated college, I jumped into Harvard's Biological and
Biomedical Science Ph.D. program, where I conducted research on axolotl
limb regeneration. While I loved working on such an amazing topic, I
decided to pursue a career in software and joined Klaviyo, an email marketing startup, in the fall of 2018.

My fiancé and I moved to Seattle in the summer of 2019, and I began
my journey to become a full stack master at The Pokémon Company International.

Outside of work, I study Japanese, crochet, play ultimate frisbee, ski,
and hike.
